Created and tested in a Raspberry Pi 3 in a 4Gb microsd card.

```
MINIBIAN is a minimal Raspbian-based Linux image for Raspberry Pi.
The main focus is to have a small, updated and stable distribution that is fully compatible with official Raspbian “wheezy” image, without GUI and unneeded tools.
So this image is perfect for embedded projects, or wherever you need to use all RPi resources for your specific tasks.
The main advantage is that MINIBIAN has a very small footprint, boots in some seconds and uses just few of precious RPi RAM.
Unlike other similar projects, MINIBIAN has not been obtained purging unneeded packages from original image, neither recompiling the source code: it’s just a customized Raspbian installation obtained from the same repository used for official RPi wheezy image.
So kernel and binary files are exactely the same you will find on standard image, with the difference that MINIBIAN fit on 512MB SD Card, is fastest, and updated more often.
